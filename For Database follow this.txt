MySql code:

Create a MySQL table:
CREATE TABLE app_reviews (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    app_name VARCHAR(255),
    review_count INT
);

Now, when you run the app.py file, you can access the web app by visiting 
http://localhost:5000 in your web browser. Keep in mind that this is a simple 
example, and you may need to implement actual API calls to Google Play Store or 
Apple Store for real review counts.
